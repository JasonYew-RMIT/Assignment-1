      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>My name is Yew Zen Jet or you could call me Jason. I was born in Malaysia and been travelling to Australia every once in a while,  to visit my parents who work in Australia. I love both cats and dogs very equally, so you could say I’m both cat person and dog person. I never really had a specific area of study I’m interested and I never really know the meaning of studying other than getting paid more with higher education qualification.</p>
      <p>At the end of 2019, I finished my high school in Malaysia and was totally lost in what I should do next. I spent most of my free time playing PC games with my friends and not planning my future. Due to the Covid-19 outbreak I was not able to go anywhere except staying home and play even more games until I saw some of my high school friends starts to take action in their Uni study. I then start my first study of SACEi (South Australian Certificate of Education) in Taylor College in April 2021. It was more like an extra one year for me to plan my future study since finishing the program will allow me to choose to study between Malaysia and Australia. </p>
      <h2>My Interest in IT</h2>

      <p>During the mid-term break of the program Taylor and RMIT decided to have three free programs for the SACE student which one of the courses is the Intro to Programming. I decided to join the course to have a better understanding of what exactly programming is about. In the course I learn a little fundamental of Python and I was really enjoying it. It was then I have a clearer pathway where I want to proceed to study in IT programming field. After finish the SACEi in April 2022. I decided to continue my study in RMIT in Australia as my family planned to stay in Australia. I was enrolled in The Bachelor degree of IT. The main objective of studying this course is that I want to know more about which area of IT I’m interested in whether it’s Web Programming or Software Developer or in Cyber Security. I’m really looking forward to it.</p>

      <h2>Ideal Job</h2>
      <p>The most ideal job for me is to be a backend developer and a hybrid working place would be good to have. I believe my strength in programming is to compile and develop a working app rather than designing UI/UX. This is because based on my current job which is an admin job in Melbourne, I was able to understand the needs of the customer and provide the best solutions and suggestion. I believe that with these skills I’m able to understand what my customers would need if I’m assigned to develop certain app or system.</p>

      <h2>My Personality Profile</h2>
      <h3>Strengths</h3>
      <h4>Relaxed</h4>
      <p>I’m able to stay quite relaxed. I would live the moment and go with the flow, not worrying too much about the future. This would allow me to always stay positive and enjoy my current life.</p>
      <h4>Spontaneous and Rational</h4>
      <p>Another strength of my personality is that I could switch mindsets to fit new situations or think from other perspective without much effort. It helps me analyse what, where and why the problem is allowing me to be flexible and versatile. </p>

      <h3>Weaknesses</h3>
      <h4>Insensitive</h4>
      <p>I tend to use logic in most scenario and even when I try to meet the others halfway with empathy and emotional sensitivity, it rarely seems to quite come out right.</p>

      <h2>My Future Project Idea</h2>
      <p>I don’t have a really ‘grand’ project in mind but I do want to work on automated machines such as automatic cloth horse. </p>
      <h3>Overview</h3>
      <p>This project is to build an automated sensor machine that detects the weather and make a specific order to deal with different scenario. It will collect data from weather forecast of the day and calculate an estimation of how likely it is going to rain. Based on the </p>
      <h3>Motivation</h3>
      <p>My motivation of making this project is that I always have to make sure the weather is fine before I can hang my clothes and leave home in peace and sometimes the weather forecast does not work 100% accurate which makes my clothes not dry. My plan of this project is to allow me to do other task while not worrying my clothes getting wet either when I’m working or not home. Furthermore, with the technologies rising in the past few years automatic machines have got more popular among human. These machines help reduce the work size of human and sometimes finish the task assigned better than human. This is because these machines work based on a coded program which is working in a regular action while human does not work exactly the same every time. </p>
      <h3>Description</h3>
      <p>Firstly, you will need to hang the clothes in the machine provided cloth horse. The hanging space will be a large square shaped which looks like a spider web but larger. 
 
        This is an image of square hanging space.
        Then you will need to turn on the power so that the machine starts to do work or else it would be just like a normal cloth horse. The machines will start collecting the data of the day weather forecast and list out all the possible raining time. For example, if 50% chance of raining in 13:00, the machine will be prepared to open the cover on top of the hanging space. Furthermore, there will be a sensor which detects the rain and send the information to the machine. This will allow the machine to open the cover when there is unexpected rain or remain unopened position if the weather did not rain according to the weather forecast. The cover of the machine will be waterproof fabric. The dimension size of the machine would be 6.5m x 6.5m x 3.2m
        The size of the hanging space would be 4m diameter 2m from the middle pole.
        The position of the hanging space would be at 1.8m
        The machine would not be able to adjust the height as more material and cost would be needed to make.
        </p>
      <h3>Tools and Technologies</h3>
      <p>To make this machine I will need material such as a custom-made hanging cloth line, a 3m stainless steel pole, waterproof fabric, a 200 to 240-volt plug (estimation), servo motor, rotor, a Raspberry Pi which contains all the command of collecting data and giving order to the servo motor, a large metal (material may vary) square box to place the CPU if the machine. Data for weather forecast will be collected form BOM (Australia Bureau of Meteorology) or other valid source. </p>
      <h3>Skills Required</h3>
      <p>Firstly, I would need to learn C/C++ or Python for machine learning and possible ROS (Robot Operating System). This will be needed to create the command for the machine to open or retrieve the waterproof fabric cover. SQL, to collect and form a database of weather forecast to the machine.</p>
      <h3>Outcome</h3>
      <p>If the project went well, I would have a working automated cloth horse. I would also produce a few more for relatives or friends and I might sell this product in the market.</p>
